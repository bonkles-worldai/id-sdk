Map editing made easy


### What is it?

This project contains code for processing and editing map data.  Our goal is to provide a shared foundation upon which developers can build map editors, data processors, validators, and other innovative tools.

Much of the code was spun out of the [OpenStreetMap iD editor](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD) project.
